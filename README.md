# Transcription
Analyze the Transcript: Read through the transcript to understand the topics discussed and the flow of conversation between the two people.

Identify Key Themes: Determine the main themes or topics covered in the interview. This can include aspects like introduction, countries and cultures, languages, recent developments, economics, etc.

Assign Tags to Sentences: Go through each sentence in the transcript and assign tags based on the content of the sentence. If a sentence pertains to a specific topic, such as discussing recent developments in economics, you would tag it with both "recent developments" and "economics".

Avoid Overlapping Tags: Ensure that each sentence is tagged appropriately and that there is no overlap or redundancy in tagging. For example, if a sentence talks about the economic situation in a specific country, it might be tagged with "economics" and "countries and cultures".

Review and Refine: Once all sentences are tagged, review the transcript as a whole to ensure consistency and accuracy in tagging. Make any necessary adjustments or refinements to ensure that the tags capture the essence of the conversation accurately.

Iterate if Necessary: If the conversation covers a wide range of topics or if there are ambiguous sentences, you may need to iterate through the tagging process to ensure completeness and precision.
